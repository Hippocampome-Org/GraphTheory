# GraphTheory
MATLAB source code for graph theory analyses on the Hippocampome.org neuron type potential connectome

Functions are included for:
- generating Barabasi-Albert, Erdos-Renyi, Klemm-Eguilez, and Watts-Strogats random networks of various sizes
- calculating absorption, driftness, and shortest path lengths between all pairs of nodes in a matrix
- building superpattern and pattern libraries (for motif/anti-motif analysis) for n=2 and n=3 node sizes
- counting and locating superpatterns and patterns in a network based on the libraries
